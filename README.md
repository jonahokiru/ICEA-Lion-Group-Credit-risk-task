# Case study

- The dataset contains columns simulating credit bureau data. Credit default risk is the risk that a lender takes the chance that a borrower fails to make required payments of the loan. The main purpose of this analysis is to predict whether a new customer can be a reliable customer. It's a way to avoid default and increase the bank’s revenue. This can be used to automate approving and declining loan applications more accurately.

# Case Study Tasks:

1. Using the attached dataset (credit_risk_dataset_training.csv) analyse the data and visualize the most important aspects using your preferred method. Furthermore, share three ideas on how to increase the % of successful loan applicants. Document your steps where needed.

2. Predict the outcome of a loan: is a customer likely to satisfy or default on the loan obligations? Use credit_risk_dataset_training.csv to train your model and credit_risk_dataset_test.csv to predict the missing value (‘loan_status’). Please document your steps and method used. Include the accuracy or evaluation metric used for calibrating your model.
